Currently, I disabled the feature to sign up a new new account. However, you can stil login using these demo accounts:

- username: demo@test.com | password: demogorgon
- username: blup@test.com | password: blupblupblup

But if you still want to make your own account, contact me, and I'm gonna enable the sign up functionality.
